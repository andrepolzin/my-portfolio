          Hello, there! My name is Andr√© and I'm a self-taught software
          developer that has been on the journey for over 2 years now. I was
          born and raised in Brazil, but in March 2019, I went to San Francisco,
          California to study English. After living there for a few months, I
          was heavily influenced by the local tech environment and decided this
          would be my future career. <br /> <br />I got my Bachelor's degree in Business
          Administration, on December 2018, in Brazil, but I knew something was
          missing. I needed something more specific, then I found out that being
          a programmer could and did filled that gap in my life. <br /> <br /> During my free
          time I love enjoying the outside. It could be a simple hike, but my
          favorite activity is fishing with friends and family. Also, I like
          reading books and watching a good TV show (Supernatural is my favorite
          one haha).
